  <p>The New York Public Library ("NYPL" or the "Library") is committed to protecting the privacy of our patrons, customers, donors, and friends (collectively referred to below as NYPL's "users").  We believe that privacy is essential to the exercise of free speech, free thoughts and free association, and we have created this Privacy Policy so that you can learn what the Library does with your information.  (This policy covers information that is collected online as well as offline.)  By using NYPL's services, including its website, and by communicating with NYPL, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  This policy may change from time to time, and we encourage you to check it periodically.

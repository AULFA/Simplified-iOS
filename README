    b. 'ant book2pngios.objonly'
        This will build libdp for Release-iphoneos. To build for other
        configurations (iphonesimulator, Debug), edit build.xml. In '<target name="book2pngios.objonly">',
        change values of all '<arg value="Release"/>' and '<arg value="iphoneos"/>'.' For the simulator, 
        change <arg value="ARCHS=arm64 armv7 armv7s"/> to <arg value="ARCHS=i386 x86_64"/>

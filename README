To build this project:

1. 'git submodule init'
2. 'git submodule update'
3. Add an 'NYPL_SIMPLIFIED_RMSERVICES_10' source tree to Xcode that points to
   "<your RMSDK 10 root>/samples/rmservices".
4. Build RMSDK 10 if you haven't already.
5. Ensure "Parallelize Build" is disabled in your Xcode build scheme. This is
   necessary for RMSDK-related projects to build properly.
6. Open "Simplified.xcodeproj" and build as normal.
